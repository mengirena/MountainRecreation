**Tech used**: HTML, CSS

## Lesson learnt

### Before start writing CSS

* Make elements border-box

```css
    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
```
* Set general font family, font size, color, line-height, `margin: 0;` under `body`
1.125rem = 18 px
Instead of doing 62.5% under `html` tag is because we want to accommodate others' change in their browser

### single-colon vs dowble-colon in CSS

* single-colon selectors are pseudo-selectors: used to selecting things that already exist, such as `:nth-child(2)`

* double-colon selectors are pseudo-elements: used to selecting things that have no HTML element for, such as `::first-letter`



### Custom CSS
