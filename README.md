## How it's built

**Tech used**: HTML, CSS

## Lesson learnt

### Before start writing CSS

* Make elements border-box

```css
    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
```
* Set general font family, font size, color, line-height, `margin: 0;` under `body`
1.125rem = 18 px
Instead of doing 62.5% under `html` tag, we want to accommodate others' change in their browser

### single-colon vs dowble-colon in CSS

* single-colon selectors are pseudo-selectors: used to selecting things that already exist, such as `:nth-child(2)`

* double-colon selectors are pseudo-elements: used to selecting things that have no HTML element for, such as `::first-letter`

### Custom CSS

Define custom CSS with name and value under `:root`: 

```css
:root {
    --name:value;
}
```

The two dash lines are necessary before the name.


### Other tips
* Opacity is applied not just the element but also its contents.

* line height

It's better to use the unitless value becasue in this way the line box height will be the multiplication of the number and the element font-size. In the block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes. 

* Use outline instead of border to style button to make the button the same size. Outline can be shifted and it won't affect other elements.

* Length unit: (ch) character count

* Negative margin is doable.

* Categorize the alignment of elements
